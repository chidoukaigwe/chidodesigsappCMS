# Chido Designs CMS

## Laravel SPA /  Vue.js 

An API driven application, built with Laravel resource collections, that enables me via a vue.js frontend to create, edit and publish articles. 

This SPA is a self consuming API, built as a content management system that feeds the articles section of my portfolio website.
